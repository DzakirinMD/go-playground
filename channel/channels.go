Goroutines can communicate with each others through channels.
A channel can be seen as a pipeline of data between two goroutines.
This pipeline can only support a specific type.

1. A channel that can can be used to SEND values of type T is denoted : chan<- T

2. A channel that can can be used to RECEIVE values of type T is denoted : <-chan T

3. A channel that can can be used to SEND and RECEIVE values of type T is denoted : chan T
